Facebook is appealing.**\n\n\n>**The court in Brussels has convicted Facebook of not abiding by the privacy law. If the internet giant doesn't immediately stop with the unbridled tracking of the surfing behaviour of the internet users from our country and destroy the illegally gotten personal information, they will be forced to pay 250 000€ per day. Facebook is appealing this judgement.**\n\n>The privacycommision in our country says that Facebook is illegally tracking our surfing behaviour. That is why last year a lawsuit was started against Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Ltb and Facebook Belgium bvba. Today the Brussels court came with their judgement: Facebook doesn't obey the Belgian privacy law. The judge followed the reasoning of the privacycommision completely. \n\n>They say that Facebook is collecting personal information on a massive scale but doesn't comply with the legal requirements. The company doesn't inform what information they collect and what they are using it for, or how long they are keeping that information.\n\n>The judge has therefor decided that Facebook has to stop tracking and registering internet use of people who surf from our country as long as they do not adjust their policy to comply with Belgian privacy law. \n\n>The social media network also needs to delete all personal information collected this way as soon as possible. If Facebook won't then they have to pay a fee of 250 000€ per day of delay with a maximum of 100 million euros. Facebook also has to publish the entire verdict, 84 pages, on their website. De ordered measurer will also appear in the newspapers of our country. \n\n>**Disappointed**  \n>Facebook says they are disappointed in the verdict and they have said they are going to appeal. \"The past years we worked hard to help make sure that people understand how we use cookies to show relevant content and secure Facebook. We created teams that specifically work for the protection of privacy, from engineers to developers. And we have created tools that can give any surfer choice and and control.\" \"The cookies and pixels that we use are standard in the sector\" Facebook continues. \"We also give users the right to opt out of certain personal information collection that occurs through our site and ads\".\n\n>**Like, share and cookies**  \n>To collect personal information Facebook makes use of three technologies: Social plug-ins (de famous like- and share-buttons), cookies (small text files that are placed on the computer of the internet user and that stay behind) en the Facebook Pixel. This is an invisible dot that virtually snoops on other websites than the one of the social network, even for non users.

Corporations do, but nowhere near enough.

The reasons are complicated and interesting.  Diagnosis anxiety, procedure pain anxiety, lack of understanding what expenses will be covered and what the patient will be responsible for, and numerous other easily fixed factors.\n  \n  \nMy employer at the time - one of the largest consulting / patient satisfaction surveying firms in the world - was more interested in asking how satisfied patients were with the temperature of their food or the the quality of the decor in waiting rooms.  \n  \n  \n  \nNo-Shows cost billions per year in lost utilization.  They are also why doctors offices double and triple book and you have to wait despite arriving on time.  There are intelligent scheduling models that can be used to factor no shows and reduce over scheduling."},{"body":"[removed]"},{"body":"Study in question\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2671405?redirect=true"},{"body":"I’m confused by this. The headline says that the conclusion of the study was that the number of “skipped appointments” was largely unaffected by the offer of a free Lyft ride. Yet the article also mentions that the study did not ask the participants whether they used alternative transportation to get to their appointments. In other words, it *appears* that the data the study gathered was whether the free lyft rides were used - not whether the people made it to their appointments via other modes of transit. Am I misreading this?  The full text of the study appears to be behind a paywall \n\nEdit: Someone has pointed out a correct reading of the article. The study was not simply tracking who used the free Lyft and who did not; they tracked who missed their appointments. So when the article mentions that the study did not ask how participants got to their appointments if they did not use Lyft, this is referring *exclusively* to the group of participants who did *not* miss their appointments. So the people who attended their appointments and also refused the free Lyft ride — the study did not ask how they got there. \n\nI would caution against drawing many conclusions from this study. (As the article also says). It’s a *very* small piece of a much more complex picture "},{"body":"So, if you read this whole thing and then think about the people they are talking about, you realize that not being able to get there is not the main reason for missed appointments."},{"body":"This is a bummer because I've really wished that Lyft or Uber were an option specifically to get my family member on Medicaid to their appointments, where I live. There's a system called Ride to Care which uses regular taxis, and they are extraordinarily unreliable (they just don't show up) or totally unprofessional (I had a driver show up at my HOUSE the day after giving my sister a ride, wanting to talk to her and hang out.) I'd give just about anything to have this opportunity. "},{"body":"One issue with the high no show rates with Medicaid is that providers can’t charge for a no show. So they are out of income for that day. When I worked fee for service at an agency I could have 8 clients scheduled for a day, but only 2 would show up. I don’t get paid for all the ones who were scheduled but didn’t come, which made the job unsustainable. We are literally not allowed to charge them no-show fees, unlike when taking private insurance. Most days I couldn’t even cover the cost of my own childcare fees. \n\nWhen people talk about a lack of access to mental and medical care, this is a huge part of it. Now that I’m in private practice there is no way in hell I will take Medicaid, even though I would like to, because of this no show policy. I’d be out of business and bankrupt in the first month. Most private healthcare providers won’t take it for this reason also, which pushes the poor to overcrowded community agencies."},{"body":"The biggest problem with healthcare will always be humans self sabotaging themselves."},{"body":"Medicaid support rep from an expansion state here... Our state already has offered contracted transportation as part of their plan for years and as a bit of good news, members who are calling in trying to find Dr's, etc and also mention they have transportation issues are usually ecstatic at the news... Unfortunately the poor who miss their appts. simply have too much stress going on in their lives or whatnot, and without being judgmental, those other life issues are quite often are the biggest factor on why they are so poor to begin with, they feel there is no way out of it and simply become apathetic to staying on top of their health... We do outreach calls to those who are \"high acuity\" to help them get PCP's established, let them know they have nurse advise and ongoing nurse health coaching available now and I would say 80-90% of them either never pickup, return our call or really care."},{"body":"Another factor could be scheduling conflicts due to work"},{"body":"Most people think they're okay, until they have to go to the emergency room. That is a problem that needs to be solved. There's incentives/obstacles in each pathway from patient to doctor (no one likes going to a hospital/clinic, and doctors can't visit every patient, but I'm sure with tech, we can figure it out hopefully."},{"body":"[removed]"},{"body":"Also something to add in, as someone who went from great insurance to Medicaid for a while, a huge issue is finding a provider that even accepts Medicaid. Because there are so few, usually it’s very hard to get an appointment with that provider. When I finally did, it was usually three months in advance and after a while you forget. On top of that when you have an unpredictable work schedule and are under a lot of stress, when they call to remind you one day before you realize you have something important you have to do that day and can’t afford to miss it. "},{"body":"[removed]"},{"body":"Maybe they did not want a medical bill. Im not originally from the US but health care here is very confusing with hmos, ppos, Medicare, deductibles, copays, in network vs out of network etc.... Maybe they were as confused as me with health insurance and simply did not want a bill for medical care because it’s hard enough making ends meet financially. "},{"body":"[removed]"},{"body":"I'm far more interested in how often Lyft was used and as a replacement for what and then what this did (and would have done, if the ride wasn't free) for the cost of the trip.

Many employers won't give someone time off for an appointment, and I can't remember the last time I had an appointment where they didn't want follow ups, labs done (on a different day), etc. Ain't nobody got time for that shit."},{"body":"Reminds me of the Oregon medicaid study, which basically showed little to none of the predicted advantages of offering medicaid vs not, in a similar population.\n\nWe are determined to not understand, that groups with different outcomes, are different groups, which behave differently and have different habits, statistically.  They are not just the same people with different levels of fortune."},{"body":"YAY another subject in my wheelhouse.\n\nI am a patient advocate that literally works with Medicaid patients. Specifically Medi-cal (California). I am currently in an upper middle class neighborhood but have worked in rural and and an urban hospital. Been doing this kind of work for 13 years now.\n\nWhen I was at the urban hospital I had about a 50% flake rate on my scheduled appointments. Here in Folsom people show up around 90% of the time.\n\nThe gods honest truth is that a lot of people on Medicaid aren't exactly what one would call 'responsible'.  A lot of poor people are in their life situation for a reason.\n\nand to the people talking about not having enough time cuz working two jobs n blah blah.........no. If you work full time you simply make too much money for Medicaid in the first place unless you have a bunch of kids at home.\n\n "},{"body":"[removed]"},{"body":"[removed]"},{"body":"I'm curious what percentage even answered the phone call. People hate engaging with their health, in my experience. What a downer."},{"body":"This is why you have to wait 30 or even 60 minutes when you get to the doctor.  They have to overbook so much to compensate for no shows.  I work for a 6 hospital multi outpatient system.  You can’t turn away Medicare or Medicare patients either.  You can’t “discourage” patients in any way as it can be perceived as denying patient care. "}],"score":23775,"num_comments":1546,"subreddit":"r/science"}

My grandma had two husbands, with the first she had two kids (my uncle Steve and my dad). With the second she had two more kids (my uncle Jon and aunt Amy). She made it excruciatingly obvious all throughout my dad and uncle Steve’s childhoods that she preferred the kids from her second marriage.\n\nShe’d do this by not giving them as much food to eat, not giving them presents at Christmas or birthdays while the two kids from her second marriage got shitloads of presents. She’d let her husband beat the shit out of my dad and uncle Steve freely, and eventually she dropped them both off with their dad and fucked off for ~8 years, saying she was going to work and was gonna pick them up later the same day.\n\nFast forward to my dad and uncle Steve being adults, my uncle is completely messed up from the abuse, became a drug addict and died because of it. My grandma hears about this when she’s on holiday, and decides to let my uncle rot in the morgue for a week instead of coming down to proceed with burial and funeral processes (she was in the same country so the journey down would have been 2-3 hours tops).\n\nWhen me and my sisters were growing up, my grandma and stepgrandad made it pretty clear we weren’t really wanted around, and stepgrandad never attended our birthdays or said more to us than a few words when we visited. My uncle Jon now has kids, and there’s loads of toys at my grandma’s for them, and my stepgrandad constantly visits them and goes to their birthdays, even though he’s now in very poor health.\n\nOne time my aunt Amy was falling out with my uncle Jon, so my grandma says “make up with him, you’ve only got one brother”. My dad isn’t her brother apparently?

They were an old couple, either retired or close to it. The husband would rile up our dog, an excitable Boston Terrier, from the other side of the fence by kicking it, yelling and throwing shit, and then call the police about how our angry, barking dog scared his poor little wife and stupid little poodle half to death. The police just let us off with a warning first to keep our dog in line, but after it kept happening they figured out they just wanted attention or some shit. The cops apologized about the disturbance, and stopped showing up. The husband would then repeatedly threaten to shoot our dog if he ever caught him barking again. He let his grandson and another neighbor regularly torment the dog through the fence and would yell at US as though WE were the problem. I'm glad we moved. \n\nEDIT: It's so sad to see other people having horror stories involving their pets and monster neighbors. I have no idea what possesses someone to think it's okay to kick, torment, or kill someone's pet just because they wandered onto your property. "},{"body":"Mine is not as severe as some of the ones posted here, but this is my story:\n\nWhen I was in college, I met this one student who was in the film program with me named Steven. Steven was loud, but in an enthusiastic way, though it could be annoying how much he was sometimes. He knew movies and could talk about them for a long time. In the film program, that can be both a good thing and a bad thing as it usually becomes an echo chamber of opinions and arrogance. \n\nAnyway, in our third year, Steven left, never having finished his film degree. I kept in contact with him though Facebook and found out that he had run out of money and could not continue attending university. He expressed depression about having to move back home and even went as far as contemplating suicide since he was in a deep slump he saw no way getting out of.\n\nOne day, he came to visit our school and we talked a bit about how he was doing. Turns out that for a few weeks, Steven was back in our college town trying to figure out what to do but was living in his car. Having had a similar experience in the past, I invited Steven to crash on our couch at the house my roommates and I rented. He didn’t have to pay, but just help with chores until he got back on his feet. \n\nAt first it was okay, but gradually, I began to see what kind of guy he really was. Steven fancied himself a film elitist, basically any movie he likes is good for whatever reason and if you disagreed or had a different taste in film, he’d ridicule you. He was a bit of a work out nut at first and would talk down fat or chubby people. One of my roommates was a big, goofy nerd who was a bit messy at times and Steven would say the worse things about him to us until we told him to calm it down. If Steven met a girl that a guy friend was talking to or involved with, he would try to talk down that guy to impress the girl. It happened at least three times with different friends. \n\nAt first, this was behind the scenes and we never knew, but over time, we began to find out little by little and got tired of his antics, his arrogance, and his lack of respect. When I found out that he was badmouthing me for being the one to chart all the chores and make the rules of the house, I told him to leave. After he left, I found out he had attempted to poison so many people (mostly girls) against us, me in particular. I was very upset since the whole reason he was there was because I wanted to help a guy in trouble during hard times. \n\nFuck you, Steven. \n\nEdit: You know the scenes in Family Guy where people will be in mid conversation and suddenly stop when he sees the giant chicken just to fight him?

We worked in a classroom setting with blind, deaf and developmentally disabled adults.  I was the leader/case manager of the room. This lady had been there for 30 or so years and was upset that I, a newer employee in her 20s was the supervisor and not her. \n\nShe got upset about me rearranging a closet one day and decided she was going to “get me back” by putting the individuals who needed assistance on the toilet and leaving them there to go on her lunch break. These were female individuals and only female staff can assist with the toilet Ming of female individuals. The third staff in my room was male so that meant I would have to assist the individuals whenever this woman left them like that. \n\nIt wasn’t a big deal for me to assist with toileting, but keep in mind that this lady would just leave them sitting on the toilet in the cold ass bathroom. Also these girls were blind and deaf, and we had other individuals with violent behavior so she left them vulnerable to be attacked (I found one of the girls in the bathroom with scratches all over her arms and face. No idea how they got there). I told her several times not to do this because there was no guarantee that I would come back to the classroom Within reasonable amount of time to be able to ensure they weren’t sitting on the toilet for ages. She’d cop an attitude and basically say I wasn’t a good team player. \n\nOne day I got pulled into a last minute meeting that ended up being an hour and a half long. I called the room and told the staff I would be in a meeting. This lady still chose to leave the girls in the toilet and go to lunch. By the time I had gotten out of the meeting and headed back to the room, the girls had been on the toilet for over an hour. So basically this lady left them in the toilet, went back to the room to hang out for a bit, and THEN took her break a few minutes before I had walked back into the room.  When she came back I tried to have an informal chat with her about what happened and she basically said she told me I was full of myself and she didn’t need to listen to what I was saying. She did not give a fuck about the uncomfortable position she left these girls in, only that she thought she was somehow spiting me. \n\nEventually I had to escalate the situation and she got charged with neglect and ended up losing her job.

When I was old enough to walk home from school by myself, I had to come up with new routes every day because I was scared of him following me (something he had done to a couple of other kids).\n\n The teachers at my school never did anything about it, partly because they didn't really care, and partly because I rarely told them.

They would often show up at our house demanding money from this elderly woman and it would break her heart. One day, her daughter shows up and demands money. I can hear inside she is screaming at her mother for money and my nanny is explaining she doesn't have any to give her. I'm outside playing and my dog Chelsea crawled under her daughters car. So I go under her daughters car to try and get my dog. Chelsea is right at my fingertips, (I was like 4-5 and I remember this vividly) I could *almost* reach her collar. I hear the front porch door slam and her daughter shriek \"You better get that little girl out from under my car or I'll run her over too.\" I'm frantically reaching for Chelsea, screaming for her and start crying. I see her feet approaching the car, she gets in, turns it on....I'm screaming to let me get my dog. My Nanny snatches me up in her arms just as her daughter steps on the gas, I will never forget the sound of my dogs bones crunching underneath her car. She was serious, she was going to run me over too. Still to this day (over 30 years later), I hope she rots in the worst hell that exists. She is truly the most evil person I have ever met. \n\nUPDATE****So I called my mom on the way home from work and asked what happened to the Nanny's daughter after all of this. Now, keep in mind this was 30 years ago, cell phones were still very new and it was rare to see someone with them. My parents got home a few hours after this happened. My father was in disbelief he thought surely there had been some misunderstanding, it could not be true. My mother, was ready to kill, quite literally. As I stated previously, My Nanny was an amazing woman and to spare her, my parents left the police out of it. My father felt like it was \"just a dog\". Chelsea was still very much a puppy (almost a year old) and my dad felt they could just buy us another dog. (My dad has always been very passive about really important family shit which is one of many reasons why my parents are divorced). My mother found my Nanny's daughter that evening and told her she had 2 options; She could give my parents the money for the puppy, Thank her lucky stars that we loved her mother dearly and never to set foot on our property again OR we could press charges and she would be arrested on a slew of animal cruelty charges as well as for threatening my life. The daughter chose option 1, gave my mom $75's (1/4 payment) and promised she would give her mother the rest of the money to give to us....she never did.\n\nMy Nanny (this made me really sad when my mom told me this); My mom didn't want my Nanny's daughter near her children, period. At the time, my Great-Grandmother needed a great deal of care (way more than my Grandmother could provide, we all lived in the same town) so my mother sent my Nanny to care for my Great-Grandmother and we hired another Nanny. She said that her daughter could have killed me in a spurt of anger and she never wanted to take that chance again. Her daughter obviously had no problem bullying my Nanny and she didn't want her to ever push her way through our house again. Sending the Nanny away was the only way to see that didn't happen again. I'm sure this isn't a satisfactory ending for most of you. This occurred in a small town and despite the sheer evil I witnessed that day; they needed to be as diplomatic as possible for my Nanny's sake. And for everyone asking if I wanted revenge, Yes. Once I was old enough to understand what that was; I did want it. Now, I have a kid the exact age I was when this happened and it really makes me realize even more-so HOW sick and evil this woman was to just take my dogs life in a fit of rage and threaten mine.

He would get naked and run around without provocation He was kicked out of seemingly everywhere that he went, yet for some reason, people kept giving him a chance, as if one day his act would suddenly clean up... until his band went on tour, and one of his bandmates caught him in the tour van masturbating to child porn. He denied it up and down. Then authorities got involved, apparently someone had been tracking his activity for a few days, and he literally packed up and ran away to God knows where. Fuck him, good riddance, the literal definition of a piece of shit. "},{"body":"My sister’s boyfriend (who she had a daughter with). \n\nHe is the most disrespectful piece of shit who gives no fucks. \n\n1. The first time we met him, my family went to his house and his mom made the food. They had a piano. My brother played a little bit on it and the baby daddy said “can you turn that shit off” and proceeded to play loud rap from the living room computer. \n\n2. Took my sisters phone once for fun. My dad called and he said he’s not giving the phone back and hung up on him. \n\n3. He and my sister came to my dads office because I was there and he asked if I could fix the computer, as in install a new version of Windows. I did it in hopes that he stops being rude to me. After I fixed it, he started using it there. My sister played a shitty Niki Minaj song as a joke and I said the song sucks. And the baby daddy said “shit if it’s a problem why do people complain if you got nothing to say.” BITCH I fixed your laptop for free and you say this shit to me?\n\n4. He crashed 2 of my sisters cars cause he drives like shit.\n\n5. One time he picked me and my sister up from school. He played loud rap and proceeded to swerve between cars and cut people off. He seems to only care about himself. \n\n6. I let him and my sister live in my apartment for about 3 weeks while they switched places. He told my younger sister to “stop messing with my shit” after she comforted our niece because he was making her cry on purpose. I said, “don’t talk to my little sis like that,” and he proceeded to get up and tell me “WHAT?” As if he wanted to fight me. BITCH IM LETTING YOU LIVE RENT FREE and you’re going to give me a fucking attitude in my own apartment??\n\n7. He came to my families apartment once to talk to my sister after they broke up. I said fine I’ll go get her and told him to wait outside and I closed the door. He then proceeded to walk in and wait in the kitchen. \n\nMy sister finally left him and idk what he did, but he got 2 years in jail (had previous history). He recently got out but my sister has cut him off so now none of us see him. He can go die. Piece of disrespectful shit. \n\nEdit: My sister is now engaged with someone wayyyyy better. "},{"body":"I would say my uncle.\n\nHe actually started in my life as the good guy. My mom had a sever accident when she was a child that left her brain permanently damaged. He not only helped her after my father broke up with her, leaving her with three children, one of them mentally and bodily, another only bodily disabled, but also took us in together with his fiancee when I was 6 and my mom became unable to care for us.\n\nWe were a nice little family, he had a successfull company that was just to start at the stocks, his fiancee (who he only not married after 11 years because his daughter from a first marriage was against it) was a wonderful woman and it was pretty perfect.\n\nUntil the day of his 59th birthday, when he opened up to his fiancee that he was cheating on her with a 26 year old girl (his own daughter was only 25). After she worked a week to make his birthday perfect, he just simply said she should leave now and that the new woman would move in next week.\n\nIt didn't took this week for him to kick us three kids out as well (I was the youngest with 10, my disabled oldest sister 20). I moved with my foster-mom, my sisters moved back to my real mom who had now a new husband and it was believed she could handle the two.\n\nThe next years my uncle managed to destroy his complete company (partly because of the way he broke up with my foster-mom, he was on the bottom of society, and was deemed to untrustworthy for his investors), but managed, by fraudulently pulling the money out of the company, to let my foster mom, who bailed for the company, fall in debt alone (for around 1,500,000 DM, the old german currency). My mom didn't went to court for that because it would have meant a prologned jail-sentence for my uncle, and the mere idea that the father of her baby (which was born dead) would end in jail haunted her too much to pull through, something my uncle did count on.\n\nHe also cheated her for 100.000 DM that my foster-mom payed for the flat for my granny, by simply claiming he payed it and by letting my grandmother actually agree to his version. Well, when my Granny became too old to care for herself she gave him full power over her finances, with the consequence that, at the time of her death, there was not enough money on her accounts for a single more week in hospital. While this time I tried to push for prosecution via my real mother, she let it drop in the end when he was diagnosed with lung-cancer, of which he finally died a couple of years ago."},{"body":"My ex partner.  Found out they had raped two people, so I listened to my gut (and the fact I was having my own consent violated and willpower to say no broken down the more time we spent together) and bounced.  They ended up spreading a bunch of shit about how *I* was the narcissistic, consent violating, abusive one, which really fucks you up when it comes from someone who was a hair's breadth away from fully assaulting you.\n\nLike it's been about 7 months since it all went down, and I'm only just realizing that quietly letting someone stick their fingers in you when it hurts and waiting for it to be over because they didn't listen the last ten times you said no probably isn't enthusiastic consent and just.  The fact that this person was lowkey assaulting me and then had the gall to try and flip the story after I finally stuck up for myself grosses me out."},{"body":"It really is an amalgamation of every single fat middle aged manager I worked with at retail jobs in college.\n\nThese men were all the same. They had given up on life, married young to their first lay, gave total obedience to the corporation, and HATED anyone young energetic and happy. \n\nTheir one goal in life was to suckle at the teat of whatever nameless soulless corporation would have them and spread their black hole of despair to anyone who believed their life maybe kind of might be worth more than a chain retail career.\n\nYou can still find these men stalking aisles day by day. They are the true vampires of the world, dead before they had a chance to live, and they will take anyone down with them."},{"body":"Barry Bonds.  Motherfucker wouldn't sign my baseball when I went to a giants game like 20 years ago.  Stupid tiny-headed asshole.\n\nObviously, I'm still salty."},{"body":"My buddy's ex girlfriend.\n\nCheated on him multiple times... he even caught her with dudes in their bed. Kept going back. Once she took his debit card to go fuck off with some guy and do a bunch of coke, drained his accounts... he still took her back. \n\nHe eventually left, but she really fucked up his self esteem so it took a while to pry him away. All his friends had to have a \"leave that ho intervention\"."},{"body":"A \"friend\" I used to go to highschool with. I hadn't seen him in years and messages me on Facebook to hangout. He comes over and is super weird, he ends up telling me in detail how he wanted to murder these two guys, rob them, and cut out their eyes for reasons unknown. I ended up recording the conversation.\n\nSix months later I am woken up by a phone call from a friend of mine who I asked what I should do with the recording. She called me to tell me he was arrested for attempted murder. It was all over the news. I called the police and testified to put him in prison.\n\nI still have the recording."},{"body":"It's a pretty close competition between the guy who had aids who robbed people (mostly drug dealers, but still)  with a syringe full of his blood. And the woman who spent her entire tax return on heroin. She had 5 kids who she claimed on her taxes so it was a couple thousand at least. Her mother took care of all of her kids for her.  Then when she ran out of the money she tried to take one of the younger girls who was 3-4 years old and sell her daughter's virginity to one of her dealers."},{"body":"My grade school bully murdered his grandmother and her dog."},{"body":"I didn't \"meet\" him, but I have been within punching distance of Joel Osteen."},{"body":"my current SO, cheated on me and even though i suspected something was up for months, i was treated as if i was paranoiac, and crazy, they even sent each other happy new years messages while i was with him and his family with mine, I just cannot fking comprehend it, i found out a couple of days ago, and it's consuming me inside. I don't know what to do... the pain is too much, we stayed together, but i don't know what to do, each day is a burden, each day i want to hurt myself. "},{"body":"Not me, but...\n\nI met a California prison guard. His first assignment had been to a medical facility that, among other things, did psychiatric evaluation & treatment. Mr. Guard's first day on the job started with a recreation area for psych prisoners, where an inmate named Charlie challenged him to ping pong. They played until lockdown time. Charlie, Mr. Guard said, was definitely \"off,\" especially the way he stared at people. \n\nAfter lockdown, Mr. Guard gets his clipboard with the list of prisoners and goes down the cells doing bed checks. That's when he discovered \"My God! I just spent the evening playing ping pong with Charles Manson.\""},{"body":"My sister's ex boyfriend.  He's serving 5 years for 'assault against an individual older than 65', which is apparently a thing.\n\nHe repeatedly threatened and shoved his 78 yo grandmother because she tried to call the police on him."},{"body":"Karen"},{"body":"My own dear sister. \n\n\nShe’s the type of person who is such a general all around snobby bitch that when she’s nice to someone, they flock to her and feel “cool” because they aren’t on her shit list. It’s like a messed up super power. At the same time though, she can’t make long lasting friends, so it sort of evens out. But because of this my family doesn’t see what a total piece of trash she is. \n\n\nShe and I were at odds all through our childhood. I feel like she was meant to be the only child. She cannot share the spotlight. But I was born and I ruined everything for her. And she treated me as such from pretty much day one. We never got along and I pretty much just picked up on her negativity and returned it. I am not a mean person by nature but it’s just natural when it comes to her as she’s always held me in contempt. I never knew how else to respond to her hatred. She was a bully. I can go into detail but she went out of her way to make me feel stupid, ugly, etc. \n\n\nBut thank god. She’s about 4 years older and she moved out and joined the military at age 18. I was free of her. Mom would give me updates and I just didn’t care. But the years softened me and once texting became a thing, she and I started a timid friendship. It was alright. In the span of about ten years I saw her in person maybe five times. Long distance seemed to work for us. When we saw each other things went well. I dare say I was effected my her stupid super power stated above. \n\n\nThen at some point, after two failed marriages, one resulting in having two kids that ended up living with their dad in another country while she married her ex’s friend (the second marriage) she ended up back home. But out of nowhere she just left, telling no one, and moved 1200 miles away across the country.  I was jealous of where she moved. Gorgeous part of the country and I hated where I lived. So we talked still. It was neutral. We even had a couple of inside jokes. \n\n\nThen tragedy struck her first husband and long story short, she regained full custody of her kids, except only one of them wanted to live with her, the other stays with her step mom. So she convinced me to move. I was happy to. To get out of our state, to go and help her when she needed it, all that. I’m home all day with my own kids so it wasn’t trouble to help her with her’s so that she could keep a job. \n\n\nSo we saved up and spent several thousand dollars moving across the country to a town about 40 minutes from her. Best we could do.  I watched her kid quite a lot. No trouble. Decent kid. And then it started to become clear. She was using me. Plain and simple. For example, I invited her over for Christmas to hang out. I was so happy. Prepared finger food, got wine, i just felt really good about spending time with family so far from our parents, ya know? Last minute she says she can’t stay long but oh, could I watch her kid? Could he spend the night? \n\n\nI said yes but I was really hurt about it. She came over for maybe 45 minutes but bolted as soon as she could.  That was my first inkling that she had never changed as a person. That she still thought very little of me. \n\n\nThen one day she tells me she’s up for a job that requires a month long training program where she could only be home on the weekends for that month. I should have realized it then with how she worded it.. but I was her last choice in solving the childcare issue. She said I could stay at her place and she’d pay me. So I agreed. \n\n\nBarely made it out of the first week. I obviously had to bring my kids, but I’m a conscientious person. I took anything breakable and placed it in her bedroom. I kept a gate up so my then 2 year old couldn’t go anywhere except the living room. I was present at all times to make sure no mischief was had. \n\n\nThen day 3, I get a wave of texts. She told me *told me* that I was going to stay home the next week and come back the following. Why? Because on her phone call with her son, who was 11, he told her a fuck ton of lies. Told her my kids dented the tv screen, broke their fire tv stick, that my daughter screams 24/7, and a few other things that put her precious belongings in peril. These were all 100% lies and I told her that. She doesn’t care. She’s going to have her boyfriend (of one month) watch her kid for a week and then *allow me* to help her more the week after. \n\n\nAfter a day of stewing in anger, I told her she could go fuck herself, that I was absolutely not returning and that she was a real piece of work to just believe her dumb kid and not even give me the benefit of the doubt, especially after how I had helped her thanklessly for months and oh, I dunno, moved across the country to help her? \n\n\nShe’s a grudge holder. I knocked her plan straight out of orbit. She is not accustomed to being told no. She’s a manipulator and is very used to people just following what she says. I have no idea what she did to adjust the plan, and I don’t care. We haven’t spoken in over a year. I do know she hates that job she got out of it, and that she’s on her third marriage (my mom thinks I care for some reason) and she’s probably using the guy because she knows she needs childcare one way or another. Dude is sticking his dick in crazy and I feel bad for him. \n\n\nAnyway cutting her out of my life felt really great. Still does. \n\n\n\n\n"},{"body":"Probably the guy who threatened to run me over with his car because I wouldn't give him discount parking. Fuck that guy."},{"body":"When I was 16 I got my first girlfriend. I was super good to her (she didn't deserve it in retrospect). She had me drive her 25 minutes to live with her mom since she was a foster child. I said well of course I'll do that. Eventually, in the new city, she met a guy and cheated on me. Now she told me she got pregnant because she was raped. But since we had sex I was afraid I might be the father (always used contraceptives)\n\nI ended up staying with her for a month after that. We broke up because she broke her phone and gave the guy she cheated on me with my number. He text me and said \"hey my girlfriend wants you to pick her up from her moms house\". From that point, we worked everything out and it was basically him who got her pregnant. I sent him a couple of the nudes she sent me as evidence and screenshots of \"I love you\" texts.\n\nAfter doing this I realize it's pretty fucked up because he left soon after that. Who wants to date a cheating whore? But now that kid is screwed. Being a mom at 17 is hard enough but have fun doing it as a single parent. "},{"body":"My ex-step dad. He constantly used my mother’s money to buy things to entice my sister and I to spend time with them. He bought a house boat, four wheelers, and even “bought” me a 1970s corvette for my 16th birthday. Found out that he just told this guy it was for me so he knocked $4,000 off the price. My mom told me since it didn’t have airbags it wasn’t safe. He was a steroid user and tried (and failed) starting a variety of businesses including a retail western-clothing store and an emergency transportation service, he even purchased a retired ambulance and “refurbished” it. After about a year of marriage and 3 years together, she left him. \n\nOn a side note, a few years back I looked him up and he ended up getting in a domestic dispute. He shot and killed another human and he’s locked up for life. Absolute piece of shit. \n\nHands down the worst person I know.

Finally I complained to HR as did another girl.  Apparently he had to go to a class regarding sexual harassment.  But he got promoted twice in the coming years. Ugh.  It really fucked me up.\n\nI finally quit and bought a one way ticket to Mexico and traveled around central america for 3 years.  But I still wish him harm.

Trump (\"Trump Campaign\") and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\n\n* In order to carry out their activities to interfere in U.S. political and electoral processes without detection of their Russian affiliation, Defendants conspired to obstruct the lawful functions of the United States government through fraud and deceit, including by making expenditures in connection with the 2016 U.S. presidential election without proper regulatory disclosure; failing to register as foreign agents carrying out political activities within the United States; and obtaining visas through false and fraudulent statements.\n\n* Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\n* On or about February 10, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators internally circulated an outline of themes for future content to be posted to ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts. Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on \"politics in the USA\" and to \"use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump- we support them).\"\n\n* From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. The political advertisements included the following:\n\n>April 6, 2016 \"You know, a great number of black people support us saying that #HillaryClintonlsNotMyPresident\"\n\n>April 7, 2016 \"I say no to Hillary Clinton / I say no to manipulation\"\n\n>April 19, 2016 \"JOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016\"\n\n>May 10, 2016 \"Donald wants to defeat terrorism ... Hillary wants to sponsor it\"\n\n>May 19, 2016 \"Vote Republican, vote Trump, and support the Second Amendment!\"\n\n>May 24, 2016 \"Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve the Black Vote\"\n\n>June 7, 2016 \"Trump is our only hope for a better future!\"\n\n>June 30, 2016 \"#Never Hillary #Hillary F orPrison #Hillary4 Prison #HillaryForPrison2016 #Trump2016 #Trump #Trump4President\"\n\n>July 20, 2016 \"Ohio Wants Hillary 4 Prison\"\n\n>August 4, 2016 \"Hillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus.\"\n\n>August 10, 2016 \"We cannot trust Hillary to take care of our veterans!\"\n\n>October 14, 2016 \"Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists.\"\n\n>October 19, 2016 \"Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is.\"\n\n* To pay for the political advertisements, Defendants and their co-conspirators established various Russian bank accounts and credit cards, often registered in the names of fictitious U.S. personas created and used by the ORGANIZATION on social media. Defendants and their coconspirators also paid for other political advertisements using PayPal accounts.\n\n* Beginning in at least 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used, without lawful authority, the social security numbers, home addresses, and birth dates ofreal U.S. persons without their knowledge or consent. Using these means of stolen identification, Defendants and their coconspirators opened accounts at a federally insured U.S. financial institution (\"Bank l \")\n\n* Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased credit card and bank account numbers from online sellers for the unlawful purpose of evading security measures at PayPal, which used account numbers to verify a user's identity. Many of the bank account numbers purchased by Defendants and their co-conspirators were created using the stolen identities of real U.S. persons. After purchasing the accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators submitted these bank account numbers to PayPal.\n\nI assume the spin from the right will involve pointing out that the Russians ran ads supporting Bernie to foster the dislike for Hillary on the left (according to these indictments) and start their standard obfuscation where they conflate random things and conjure up false equivalencies.\n\nRan ads against Trump's challengers in the primaries and against his almost-guaranteed challenger in the general election? Tried to make liberals stay home on election day by using the bad blood from the primaries? Don't you mean *theytriedtosupportliberalstoobothsidesarethesamethisisabignothingburger*?\n\nThat, or they'll look at the part where it briefly mentioned that these specific Russians (who seem like they're just the lower-level ones running some of the Russian ads in America) were in contact with the Trump campaign without disclosing their actual Russian identities and say \"maybe the Russian interference happened, but no collusion!\" ignoring the guilty pleas from multiple Trump advisors for lying to the FBI, the repeated undisclosed contacts with Russian officials they tried to cover up, the Trump Tower meeting, the secret backchannel Kushner tried to set up, the fact that Trump himself won't even acknowledge the Russian interference and has refused to implement the overwhelmingly popular bipartisan sanctions, the constant dodging from Trump as Mueller tries to interview him under oath, and 50 other things I don't have the time to type out.\n\nEDIT: Also from today, another guilty plea from someone:\n\n[Mueller Announces Guilty Plea of California Man in Investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-announces-guilty-plea-of-california-man-in-investigation)\n\nEDIT 2: You can already see the spin coming from these comments from Rosenstein:\n\n>There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the election.\n\n*In this indictment* is the key phrase. Mueller's very expansive investigation at this point covers Russian interference, possible collusion from the Trump campaign, and obstruction of justice. The indictments today are pretty much just focused on the first of the three. You can't pick and choose which aspects from Mueller's investigation you want to believe, because he's already indicted multiple Trump campaign officials, received multiple guilty pleas from Trump campaign officials for lying to the FBI, and flipped multiple people. That's not \"they definitely 100% colluded!\", but it *is* way closer to that than the \"they concluded no collusion, shut down the investigation!\" angle.\n\nAs to the second part, we have already heard from multiple IC officials that none of them are commenting on whether or not this interference had an effect on the outcome of the 2016 election. \"There is no allegation of it affecting the outcome\" != \"it did not affect the outcome\". Their role as investigators is to provide factual information on who did what, not speculate on alternate timelines. Since it's near-impossible to accurate predict those outcomes, any conclusion would just be accused of partisan bias and met with cries of \"how could they possibly know what would have happened?\" regardless of which way the conclusion fell."},{"body":"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/964562512862765067\nhttps://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/964561472746672129\n\nThey were using social media accounts to try and get minorities to either not vote, or to vote third party.

The center itself survived, but Congress included language in the 1996 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1997 that “none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.” Referred to as the Dickey amendment after its author, former U.S. House Representative Jay Dickey (R-AR), this language did not explicitly ban research on gun violence. However, Congress also took $2.6 million from the CDC’s budget — the amount the CDC had invested in firearm injury research the previous year — and earmarked the funds for prevention of traumatic brain injury.\n\n>A report released in January 2013 by the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, found that since 1996 the CDC’s funding for firearm injury prevention has fallen 96 percent and is now just $100,000 of the agency’s $5.6 billion budget. https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2013/02/gun-violence.aspx"},{"body":"“In the area of what works to prevent shootings, we know almost nothing... ” except that countries that are not awash in guns have almost no gun violence.

Matt Bevin seemed to distill this view with a tweet noting, “You can't regulate evil.”\n\nThey do their damndest to regulate morality, so I don't see much difference."},{"body":"The dickey ammendment didn't actually ban firearms research by the CDC. It banned the CDC from advocating and lobbying against the 2nd ammendment after repeated snafus by their leadership at the time saying that their sole reason for researching firearms was to ultimately ban them entirely. They are still fully able to conduct whatever gun research they please, they just have to release it like any other study and let the politicians to the politicing.\n\nThe CDC has actually done firearms research fairly recently, you just don't really hear about the 2013 study because it showed that firearms are used defensively 10-80 times more often than they are used in violent crime.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nFrom:Public Health Gun Control: A Brief History—Part II Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership\n\nIn Part I of this series we saw that a top CDC official in 1989 had announced, “We’re going to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths. We’re doing the most we can do, given the political realities.” (P.W. O’Carroll, Acting Section Head of Division of Injury Control, CDC, quoted in Marsha F. Goldsmith, “Epidemiologists Aim at New Target: Health Risk of Handgun Proliferation,” Journal of the American Medical Association vol. 261 no. 5, February 3, 1989, pp. 675-76.) Dr. O’Carroll later said he had been misquoted and disavowed any pre-existing agenda. But his successor Dr. Mark Rosenberg was quoted in the Washington Post as wanting his agency to create a public perception of firearms as “dirty, deadly—and banned.” (William Raspberry, “Sick People With Guns,” Washington Post, October 19, 1994, quoted by Kates, et. al. in Tennessee Law Review article mentioned below). The preponderance of evidence points to a political agenda at the CDC.\n\nBy the early 1990s the CDC’s plan was well underway, as evidenced by a New England Journal of Medicine article whose lead author was Dr. Arthur Kellermann. Dr. Kellermann, eventually a recipient of over $1.7 million in CDC grant money, was a vocal supporter of gun control who was prominently quoted in the mainstream media. Those media outlets, the big city newspapers and major television news outlets of the time, were known then, as now, to share Kellermann’s view.\n\nDr. Kellermann’s article, “Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home,” (New England Journal of Medicine vol. 329, no. 15, October 7, 1993) was supported by two grants from the CDC. The authors used a case-control method usually used in epidemiology research to investigate a criminology problem. Their conclusion, summarized as a factoid still quoted by gun control advocates to this day, was that people with a gun in the home are 2.7 times as likely to become homicide victims as people who don’t keep a gun in the home.\n\nGun control advocates and a sympathetic media cited Kellermann’s article endlessly, providing pseudoscientific justification for politicians looking for any reason to advance gun control. But the research methodology used by Kellermann and his coauthors was flawed. Aside from the unusual use of the case-control method more suited to epidemiology studies, the subjects for the study were highly aberrant. They were selected only from homicide victims in Shelby County, Tennessee; King County, Washington; and Cuyahoga County, Ohio. As the metropolitan areas including Memphis, Seattle, and Cleveland respectively, they were skewed toward inner city populations with high rates of violent crime.\n\nThe authors based their results entirely on people who had been murdered in their homes, a group wildly unrepresentative of gun owners in general. The authors themselves admit that half of the homicides occurred in connection with a “quarrel or romantic triangle” and 30 % occurred during the commission of drug dealing or another felony such as robbery, rape, or burglary. They made no attempt to consider the hundreds of thousands of responsible gun owners in the same geographical study areas who, like most gun owners, were not the type of people who commit violent felonies or become homicide victims.\n\nRead more here: https://drgo.us/?p=285\n\nThe public health push for banning guns goes back to the late 1980s at least. In a 1989 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) official Patrick O’Carroll, MD stated “We’re going to systematically build a case that owning firearms causes deaths. We’re doing the most we can do, given the political realities.” (P.W. O’Carroll, Acting Section Head of Division of Injury Control, CDC, quoted in Marsha F. Goldsmith, “Epidemiologists Aim at New Target: Health Risk of Handgun Proliferation,” Journal of the American Medical Association vol. 261 no. 5, February 3, 1989, pp. 675-76.) The CDC’s anti-gun activism ran unabated until the mid-1990s. We shall discuss those events in Part II of this series.\n\nhttps://drgo.us/?p=266\n\nAnd\n\nThere’s an overview in The Federalist which goes over the background.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin came in 1995 when the Injury Prevention Network Newsletter told its readers to “organize a picket at gun manufacturing sites” and to “work for campaign finance reform to weaken the gun lobby’s political clout.” Appearing on the same page as the article pointing the finger at gun owners for the Oklahoma City bombing were the words, “This newsletter was supported in part by Grant #R49/CCR903697-06 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”\n\nTldr: Federal Agencies shouldn't have an agenda other than carrying out the mission of their Agency. The CDC shouldn't be advocating for policy, they should be conducting studies and letting the legislative and chief executive shape policy based upon those studies."},{"body":"The amendment applies just to the CDC for apparent political advocacy. The issue I see with it is that there's some sort of assumption that any suggestion for gun control is somehow purely agenda driven. Perhaps, actually, the research really does show that gun control is the right approach, and Congress is likely just trying to avoid that conclusion."},{"body":".... How did I not know about this?\n\nThis is just disgusting."},{"body":"THAT'S what it's called.  God, I was talking with someone about this the other day and couldn't figure it out."},{"body":"There is NO excuse not to support this, whether you're on the left or right\n\nEdit: supporting research, not the ban"},{"body":"I'll take this hostage of American democracy by corporations and living in constant fear as payback for the Washingron Consensus and dirty war/Operation Condor in Central and South America.

OP clearly seems like a thoughtful and responsible parent, who is doing his best to raise his son right. We mods take no issue with his approach, and we're glad that he took the time to educate his son as thoroughly as possible.\n\nOur rule #1 (our rules are in no particular order, so it's not necessarily the most important!) prohibits those under 18 from posting/commenting on this sub. That rule is there for several reasons; one of those is that the preponderance of evidence shows that exposing developing brains to drugs, including cannabis, has long-term negative effects on brain development and function. These effects are above what happens to exposing adults to the same drugs ([here](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/11/marijuana-brain.aspx) is a good write-up, if you'd like to learn more). Officially, we do not support those under 18 from using cannabis, and will ban users who post here while underage.\n\nThat said, we mods aren't dummies, contrary to the numerous users who tell us otherwise daily. We know that many people have their first experience with cannabis while underage (and their second, and third, etc.) including some of us mods. Weed smokers are rule-breakers by nature, and many of them aren't going to be reached by scientific studies telling them that *this fun thing over here!* is actually bad for them. We can only do what we consider to be the most responsible thing, which is to keep underage toking out of our community so as not to glorify or normalize it.\n\n*That* said, our sister subreddit /r/saplings is dedicated to new and young users, including those under 18. If you have any questions, would like to know more, or just want to have a community to share your experiences with, they're a great resource. We always point users who are under 18 to that subreddit, because they're education-focused and purpose-built for users like them.\n\nAll that said, once again, we support OP for judging his individual situation and doing what he considered to be the most responsible thing.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** I lied. There is no TL;DR. Underage smoking is a complex issue that deserves a complex response. If it applies to you and you're too high to read a couple paragraphs about it, sober up and read it tomorrow."},{"body":"shit, my parents told me to move out when they found out l was smoking"},{"body":"I always picture the scenario in my head when I get a kid and I find him with weed, I always wanted to go full blast on him, watch him scared shitless, and then hit the weed in front of him, that’ll mind fuck him real nice"},{"body":"almost how i dealt with Number One Son, ~17 years ago. when he was 16 he got caught by the cops in a park with 3 friends. they saw the cops first and my son grabbed all the stuff and put it in his pocket. told the cops it was all his.\n\nhe got ticketed and a bunch of community service. his friends helped where they could, mostly with his school work and running errands. he did this because he knew his friends would get in a whole lot more trouble than he would/did at home.\n\nand he was right. after his court date, i took him aside and told him how proud i was of him for what he did for his friends. then we smoked a J (he rolled, pretty damned good too), and talked about the same stuff you did.\n\nhe knew he'd be in less trouble because we're pretty liberal in our house and talked about cannabis a lot. at that point he didn't *know* that we smoked, but was pretty well versed about legalities and common sense and knew what to do without even asking his friends.\n\nwe continue to smoke and teach each other tips & tricks. he's 30 now, a good, knowledgeable ent in his own right, and i'm now 61."},{"body":"When I was 14 my neighbors invited me to see the Grateful Dead.

Sometimes he'd hang w us, sometimes he wouldn't. It was just so nice to have somewhere safe to go. I wish my parents were like this, and now I know that I will be a parent like this. I want my kids to feel comfortable and safe with me rather than get in trouble doing it somewhere else. "},{"body":"But what are your thoughts about weeds effects on brain development? Seriously just a friendly question. As a married woman, one day I hope to have chillins of my own, and I’ve always figured I would tell them to wait until 21 for this reason. I’m just not sure what I would’ve done or if I would’ve done the same thing. Maybe I would allow one time and then enforce the rule of waiting till 21? Once won’t mess you up, right? IDK! 😱\n\nEdit: btw that was a delightful father and son story. ☺️\nEdit 2: please don’t downvote this to hell. I’m honestly looking for advice from an actual parent.

I had smoked outside, came back in and set my bowl down on a dresser. He knocked came in and we bullshited for a minute as he was standing right over this cool skull bowl I had. I had forgotten I set it there, he looks down picks it up and comments on how cool it is (it was a really cool bowl for a then 17yo kid) and asks for a lighter. I froze and couldn't process what was going on. I gave him a lighter we cleared the bowl and he left. I think he told me to turn down the music on the way out, but either way really cool experience. "},{"body":"I don't smoke, but I am an AP Calculus teacher. \n\n*You make goddamn sure that he doesn't smell like weed when he gets to the testing site.*\n\nEvery so often, somebody does something stupid with the AP test, like smoking pot in the bathroom during the damn thing. Make sure that he knows to keep his hobbies separate from his obligations. "},{"body":"Shit man,  that's better than your sixteen year old daughter sending titty pics to a HS  friend like I caught mine doing last week. \n\nCan't smoke over that one. "},{"body":"For me, the most valuable thing about reading this is that you're forming a connection with your kid in relation to 'drugs'. Sure there are elements of ethics and morals, but when aren't there? You took the step to educate and connect with your kid, and have hopefully avoided slightly traumatising him when it comes to such 'forbidden fruits'. \n\nDrugs can get tricky man. What I would give to be on a level where I feel comfortable talking to my parents about my experiences and relationships with drugs, pros and cons. I definitely feel pretty guilty about a lot of it, and while I've come a lonnggg way in learning about how they affect me, moderation, and taking responsibility for my actions... This is something that would be a lot more comfortable if my parents were able to understand it. Even if they didn't approve, but were at least respecting my right to make my own decisions. Drugs have played a big part in my life the past few years, and I really value these experiences, but I definitely feel very disconnected from my parents with it all. \n\nYou sound like a great dad. I think it's far more important to know that there's someone so close to you (you for your kid) that you're able to be open about with this sort of thing. Communication is everything, and you've taken your communication with your kid to another level. As far as I can see, that's one of the healthiest things that could ever happen.\n\nAlso, from what I've learned, smoking (a lot) before the age of 20 can definitely mess with the rest of your mental development. Kudos to you for not demonising drugs, but please reinforce that there will be plenty of time for it all later on.\n\n\"There's a time for everything, and that time is college\". - Chef, South Park"},{"body":"Im just gonna say this: Lots of parents share a beer with their kid at 16. And we know weed is less harmful. And I know the whole thing about fully developed brains at 25 or 21 or whatever the fuck, but lets be honest, most of us didn’t wait until 21. Life doesn’t work like that."},{"body":"AP Calc? ...the kid is gonna be just fine. 👍 👍"},{"body":"I'm really curious how the people in /r/parenting would respond to this"},{"body":"My mom called the police and pressed charges on me for a \"nick\" I bought when I was 14 years old. That turned into 14 months of a rehab program called Drug Court.. which led to me meeting all sorts of wild people, which led to me trying LCD, Ectasy, Cocaine, fucking name it and I did it when I was younger.  \n\nYou are a good parent and this is how to properly parent your children, you don't call the god damn Sheriff to parent your child.  I am 35 years old now and I still hate my mother for this, I will never forgive her."},{"body":"Never smoked with my dad. Maybe once my enlistment if over in five months I can try it, even though I'm 31. I don't drink anymore so it could be something fun to do hanging out with my dad. Plus my dad takes a lot of medications for his back and drinks a lot so some medical weed or regular stuff could be good for him. "},{"body":"Idk, I feel like that is just too young to start and it is not a great habit to pick up purely because of the legality issue if you aren't in a legal state. Like, you shouldn't make it seem like it is ok when he is that young, don't make it some terrible thing but don't just let him smoke himself out of school or some shit."},{"body":"this is essentially how my dad handled me smoking, and i’ll love him forever for it. he just wanted me to be safe (and share every once in a while lol)"},{"body":"My dad knew I smoked throughout my teenage years. I knew he smoked when I was about 8 years old (25 now). He never saw it a problem with me when I was in high school, he only told me \"don't get caught, and don't piss your mother off\" (getting caught usually meant my mother would be pissed off). \n\nHe always said he wouldn't smoke with me until I was 18. Well, wouldn't you know, I woke up on my 18th birthday (a Saturday) and he had a bowl packed and ready to go for us. And that's when my dad stopped being a \"dad\" and started being my friend. And even after that, he always wanted to toke up with me whenever he could get the chance. \n\nI think you handled it the right way, only thing different was waited till he was 18. But that's not my call. But I never looked at it as a \"forbidden fruit\" even though how much my mother hated that I smoked because she never saw any benefit to it despite her being a coke head in the 80's."},{"body":"I don't know how people are complaining. It honestly means the world if your parents can sit down and talk to you one on one about these topics. Most teens are rebellious or think their parents don't understand but it catches them off guard when a parent understands what's going on. Good job on your parenting skills. You're doing an awesome job. "},{"body":"I'm all for smoking weed...AFTER you are older than 18. Or even older. Your brain is still being developed."},{"body":"You handled it well but a 16 year old really shouldn't be smoking weed regardless. There's a reason why parents have to be the bad guys sometimes. Speaking as someone who's had a father who thought of our relationship more as friends than as father and son, I can tell you that you can't handle all situations like this. Occasionally parents have to be bad guys for the kids to understand they're parents, not friends."},{"body":"My mom did this with booze and I turned out to be an alcoholic.  Unfortunately her supervision made no difference in how booze and weed probably adversely and permanently affected my brain development."},{"body":"Good for you sir.  I believe you made theg right decision for you, and a good one at that.  It's your kid and your decision, and as a parent, you would not do anything to jeopardize him. It sounds to me like  he hasn't been lightin' up for long  because he was cutting it up on the kitchen counter, and not using something like a grinder. Obviously he's doing  well in school because you mentioned that he is in AP classes; therefore, IMO,  your decision as his parent is justified. I have an 8yo son and would follow suit if in the same circumstances. Keep up the great parenting Dad, your son will thank you later! : )"},{"body":"Get prepared for him and his friends smoking weed at the house lol. When we found out my friend’s dad was chill with weed we smoked all the time there, we just asked him if it was okay first. He was such a great guy, whenever he went to the store he made sure to stock up on cheap fillers like ramen and eggs just for us."},{"body":"I cannot tell you how much I wish my parents handled catching me with weed better. They screamed at me and told me all of the dangers and how I’m going to turn out to be a lazy fuck and aspire to nothing. \nJokes on them, I bought a house at 18, started a business by 20,  All while smoking multiple times a day. "},{"body":"be sure to explain to him the negative points about smoking with an underdeveloped brain "},{"body":"People are jumping to suck your dick for this, and while I think punishment might not have been productive, it was really shitty to not involve your wife. You two are a parenting team. I don't care if you were right, you should have got her on board first. "},{"body":"I'm almost 19 just got caught by my parents 2 days ago they sat me down and made sure I understood the legality consequences and not to drive with it they stressed they didn't like it and wanted to make sure that I'm smart about it. They now let me smoke in the backyard when I'm home for the night and I can honestly say that the way you handled it and my parents is the best way to handle it screaming and yelling only makes things worse you're a great parent ."},{"body":"My father told me, “I’ll deport you from England if I find you smoking weed”. God does it add pressure."},{"body":"> (she has a point)\n\nThis guy husbands."},{"body":"Just a quick word of warning: I would not use one of those cheap gas station pipes *ever* if I were you. Those things are liable to be so poorly made you wind up inhaling glass. If this is going to be an ongoing thing with you and/or your son, splurge a little and buy something that's better made."},{"body":"Having my first experience being very similar, at least anecdotally, I can say it was pretty effective. Theres breaking laws yada yada but thats part of growing up, kids are gonna do it regardless. I agree with pretty much everything you said/did but maybe wouldve got wife's consent a little more clearly lol, gotta keep on the same page especially with this stuff. Anyways, the way I see it is if its something dad would sit down and do and not make a big deal out of it then it loses its mysticism like you said and if he isnt big on pot he'll just drop it. I just had my first son 2 days ago so maybe I know nothing but I think ya dun good."},{"body":"This is really cool of you to do. I grew up in a Catholic environment where they taught us drugs would kill us, not to mention I had a drug addict father who left us so it made me super nervous. My older brother had a conversation with me when I was about 13 letting me know if I ever wanted to smoke pot, to let him know so I could do it *safely*. I was so sheltered I cried and thought, \"I would never do that, drugs are bad and I'll end up like our dad!\" Looking back I really appreciate his concern and I'm glad we talked about it."},{"body":"I remember when I was 15 and my folks caught me, at first they got mad and told me to stop, I did for a while and got back in to it about 6 months later... After they caught me the second time it totally changed, they didn't mind if I smoked as long as I was safe and all. Come to learn both my parents smoke occasionally."},{"body":"You know it isn’t good for a 16 year old to smoke pot or drink alcohol. If you change your mind about the direction you took, remember that it is a parent’s prerogative to be a hypocrite for their kids well-being. Also, your son knows it isn’t a good idea to smoke pot at that age. "},{"body":"Didn’t you kinda just foster an association between your relationship and your love to a drug? Yea, he’s definitely going to smoke weed now. \n\n\n"},{"body":"High school administrator here and, believe it or not, I’m not anti-weed. I have adult friends who indulge and they are fine. That said... I have students who smoke, a lot... and it’s who they are... they are loser stoners. They embrace it. They get shit grades and they aren’t going to get a traditional diploma in 4 years, or 5. They just want to be stoned. All day, every day. Im not kidding most of them have a less than 0.5 gpa. When I talk to their parents do you know what they tell me??? “It’s just a little weed man, relax,” or “he has anxiety (or ADD) so he’s self medicating! At least he’s not taking those pills the doctor forces on him. Weed is like medicine!”\nI wish I was exaggerating, and it’s probably a huge minority of kids who smoke...  im just saying there is clearly such thing as a parent who is “too cool”. "},{"body":"Can't believe this sub. I'm hardcore pro-legalization, but this is irresponsible and kinda fucky thing to do."},{"body":"What makes me sad, as I get older my parents still have a weed stigma, and there distaste, for something less harmful then cigs, or alcohol has pushed us apart"},{"body":"Here’s a reverse, I know my parents smoke weed. Do I tell them I do too?"},{"body":"Nice work, Dad!"},{"body":"Good for you sir.  I believe you made theg right decision for you, and a good one at that.

But good on you for dealing with this in the appropriate matter. Much respect. "},{"body":"Wish my parents reacted like this, instead they acted as if was adicted to f@€#ing crack"},{"body":"I have a lot of respect for you and your parenting.  My dad had the same attitude when it comes to weed "},{"body":"I confessed to my parents before they knew I smoked; Big mistake they called the police and I got put on probation. You are a kick ass dad."},{"body":"Had a similar experience with my parents about alcohol. My father always said \"we teach our kids how to grow up in the world, right from wrong, manners, etc. we might as well teach them how to drink (in this case smoke) responsibly so that when they inevitably try it they're educated on the issue. \n\nThis type of upbringing really helped me when I got to college. All the other kids drinking like idiots and blacking out and I never had that problem due to proper education in my household. "},{"body":"Omg. I wish I had a parent like you. My dad threatened to put me in an institution and rehab once for smoking and insisted all of my problems were from bad decisions due to my brain cells dying from weed. "},{"body":"I think the greatest thing about your parenting there is, that your son can now see you as a person to talk to. When he has problems he can come to you, talk about it and solve the problem. Thats a huge thing. Often kids think they cant talk to their parents because they think it will just add problems to existing ones. I think what you did there was great!"},{"body":"16 year olds should not be smoking weed. You could have made your point without encouraging it. "},{"body":"When I was 19 my step-mom went out of town (which she never does, because they have a farm) and my Dad asked my friend and I if we could get him some weed (he -never- smokes weed, and my step-mom hated drugs of all kinds back then, and wasn't fond of drinking either, now she's way more chill, 10 years later). Anyways, me and my friend got some weed and smoked with my Dad. \n\nTen minutes later, I found him standing in the living room, just... standing there, looking stuck. He was trying to get up and change the music, but he had become frozen. \n\nI sat him down and changed the tunes and chilled with him for a bit, before leaving.\n\nNext day he was sort of livid. That was \"super-pot\" he said, and he would never touch it again. Guy hadn't smoked since the 60s or 70s. We're in BC Canada by the way. This was 10 years ago, and even back then the weed was powerful as hell. \n\nFirst and last time smoking with my Dad. "}],"score":17237,"num_comments":1140,"subreddit":"r/trees"}

It could form this because it was cooled from one particular point or side. In your freezer, the water is being cooled from all sides (and it has different levels of minerals and gases dissolved in it) that makes crystals start forming from multiple nucleation points. When many crystals form with crystal boundaries, light gets refracted across these boundaries and that's why it appears cloudy. \n\n'Crystal clear' can sometimes be counterintuitive because apart from the case of single crystals, the more crystalline something is the more opaque it becomes.

At the time, all of the referees believed it to be real, but the debate was if it should be announced before the tape was verified. I've been trying to track down how everyone voted; I know Adam voted AGAINST announcing it, and I believe David voted FOR it, as his was the final vote \\(whether it was democratic or not, I don't know\\).\n\nHowever, I also know the owner of Twin Galaxies at the time, Pete Bouvier \\(who passed away last year, RIP you weirdo \\(and I say that with love; he and I spoke a couple of times over the phone\\)\\) was pressuring the refs to allow it. I also know Billy was involved too. I hadn't heard of any negative pressure, but more \"Come on, this needs to happen, you know he's legit\" kind of thing \\(aka peer pressure\\).\n\nSo yes, Todd was the one who \"verified\" it as he \"watched it in person\", but it looks like there's more to that story.\n\nSource: I'm a former ref for TG.

I recommend listening to the audiobook read by Adams himself, if you're into that kind of thing."},{"body":"What’s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like … ow … ound … round … ground! That’s it!

You should listen to the radio series. Also, go play Monkey Island."},{"body":"Please also consider the Dirk Gently books (only 2 of them sadly) - different but still very Douglas Adams and IMO just as good as H2G2.\n\nGreat quote from him:\n\n\"Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, \"This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, may have been made to have me in it!\" This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. We all know that at some point in the future the Universe will come to an end and at some other point, considerably in advance from that but still not immediately pressing, the sun will explode. We feel there's plenty of time to worry about that, but on the other hand that's a very dangerous thing to say.\"\n\n\nI also liked finding out that his initials are DNA :)"},{"body":"> \"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.\"\n\nGreat read.  The movie is also pretty good."},{"body":"Read Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency next"},{"body":"I am a fan of the series, to my knowledge he did not have any ailments like most great writers. He died of a heart attack at age 49. \n\nWhenever he was in grade school he was so tall that whenever the teacher would gather the class on a field trip, it was always meet under the adams.\n\nFavorite quote would have to be most of Marvin's parts. \"Life, don't talk to me about life.\"\n \"Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they tell me to take you up to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I don't.\""},{"body":"I've recently finished the first book, and yeah, it's amazing. I mean, his blunt use of English is just superb. \"A species so primitive, they still think digital watches are a pretty *neat* idea\". I also like how he chooses the right level of abstraction too \"Most ideas of how to solve the problem of unhappiness had to do with the movement of small green pieces paper. This was odd, because, generally, it wasn't the green pieces of paper who were unhappy\".\n\nYou should definitely read the introduction to \"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (the omnibus book), in which he explains, in his funny style, the history of the creation of the books."},{"body":"> Did Adams suffer from depression, ADHD or do drugs? Some of the sections feel like fever dreams.\n\nNah. He was just British.\n\nWant to read something amazing, cue up his book \"Last Chance To See\" next.  "},{"body":"« It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes »"},{"body":"I am so jealous. I wish I could read it again for the first time and be surprised by all of it.

Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.\"\n\nSuch a great series, my favorite by far."},{"body":"...in a locked basement with a sign that read “beware of panther”.

Do you think that's the sort of thing that you're likely to say?\n\n Oh no, not again.\n\n"},{"body":"I've always wanted a tattoo. One that puts a little bit about how I like to see myself on my skin. \n\nI finally got a tattoo of the cover of hhg2g on my arm. With the words don't panic. \n\nI love it. \n\nSo many favorite lines. \nBut I think \"so long and thanks for all the fish\" will always be my favorite.\n\nAnd yet, it's so difficult for me to explain that joke to people.

When I first read this for myself (my father read it to me as a child) I was a musical theater major and we had just done Carousel at my school. I HATED it. Dumb musical. Anyways, it’s summertime and I’m hanging at the pool with my friend and I read that section and I laugh out loud and half the pool looks at me- but I didn’t care because that’s the beauty of Douglas Adams- he makes you laugh out loud with tons of people around  and it honestly feels good!\n\nALSO- you should read Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency next- very fun book- I’m on the second one right now! There’s also a show that my dad and I watched together. It only got two seasons before it was cancelled, but I think it really stands up to the spirit of Adams’ writing style. It’s on Hulu if anyone is interested! "},{"body":"He seems to have been a lively, cheerful guy who mixed with the likes of Salman Rushdie, Christopher Hitchens and the like. He smoked very heavily and played squash..and quite probably died as a result of those activities."},{"body":"for some reason most people hate mostly harmless and it's my fave book in the series. Hilarious stuff."},{"body":"I really wish I could read them for the first time again."},{"body":"“He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which.”\n\nI just read the omnibus straight through for the first time. And I also recommend Dirk Gently, I liked those books better than some of the sequels. "},{"body":"So true! The book is full of amazing one-liners! Though, I was (am!) going through an existential crisis when I read it, so this quote stood out the most for me -\n\n> The chances of finding out what’s really going on in the universe are so remote, the only thing to do is hang the sense of it and keep yourself occupied."},{"body":"\"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.\"\n\nProbably my favourite quote ever."},{"body":"I literally carry a towel with me everywhere because of this book. "},{"body":"\"... like being hit in the head with a lemon peel wrapped around a large gold brick\" always stuck with me."},{"body":"Dude (dudette?)! I'm also reading it for the first time and about halfway through!"},{"body":"Dont be sad youve only begun reading them now.... im sad ive already read them. .. haven't found a book so qurkily satisfying since. And even though ive read all 5 a few times, the first time around is the best. "},{"body":"You may want to check out Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. It has much in common with Hitchhiker's, although in other ways it is very different."},{"body":"You appreciate life (and literature!) a lot more when you realize you don’t need drugs or illnesses to be creative. Frankly, many artists find that stereotype insulting. Some people just think hard and arrive at great ideas. You can too, even without a tab of acid. \n\nReally glad you finally found his work. Robert Asprin is another hilarious and brilliant fantasy author worth checking out. "},{"body":"Man, I envy you. I’d love to experience those again for the first time. "},{"body":"\"Our basic design flaws are completely obscured by our superficial design flaws...\""},{"body":"I can’t remember the exact quote but there’s a section in possibly the second or third one Where he describes a strange far away planet whose inhabitants are all mattresses and describes all of the sounds they make when they move. I was crying from laughter."},{"body":"\"It is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.\""},{"body":"I just finished the first one. I thought it would be longer (I'm on the Kindle app) and that the movie was just the first book. I watched the movie when it came out and loved it (even though I was apparently the only one who did) and was a little confused as to why the first book ended where it did.\n\nAlso I learned that the author of my favorite book series in mid-jr high school wrote the last book. (Still waiting for the Artemis Fowl movie) "},{"body":"Probably one of best set of books ever written. \n\nRemember - Don’t Panic\n\nand the answer is 42. "},{"body":"“A common mistake that most people make when designing something completely foolproof is to underestimate the enginuity of complete fools.” \n\n“I am single handedly responsible for the evolved species you come to know in later centuries as the giraffe.”"},{"body":"Ha!  I was going extra-crazy this January (from S.A.D.), and wanted this book as confort, but couldn't find it.\n\nUnexpectedly found a roommate, and had a gigantic cleaning fit.   There is was, and I'm rereading it now!\n\nOnly problem is Marvin.  He can trigger some serious existential crises :-/"},{"body":"It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination."},{"body":"Keep reading. The sequels get substantially more melancholy, basically painting the human race as the most boring, unimaginative, worthless things in the galaxy. The ending of the last book is also a pretty big downer. It's still incredibly entertaining, but in a very mean-spirited sort of way. I think it's a valid guess that Adams suffered from some sort of depression."},{"body":"Straiggt up my favourite series ever, and it seems unlikely that will change. If you're not already aware/planning to read it, there was a final book written by Eoin Colfer (think that's right) after Adams' death called \"And another thing\", I believe there are mixed opinions on it but personally I thoroughly enjoyed it and think he did an amazing job of capturing Adams' style. I cannot recommend this series enough despite the fact you're already part way through it."},{"body":"Crazy how insipid his writing is. "}],"score":2108,"num_comments":385,"subreddit":"r/books"}

He would scream in distraught every night.\n\nGod's response: Buy a lotto ticket. \n"},{"body":"Does he have a single tweet in which he isn't jerking himself off? "},{"body":"Yeah that's why we also give our thoughts as well, just in case the prayers aren't enough."},{"body":"The prayers aren't for keeping kids alive, that's why they come after the fact. They're praying that people won't be motivated enough to actually address the problem, which is working quite well."},{"body":"What a terrible thing to tweet in the wake of a tragedy. There are friends, family, and communities who lost some of their closest members. \nThere is a time to analyze and dissect how we can help prevent another mass shooting but before a parent has even buried their child is too soon for a sarcastic quip."},{"body":"I had a lot of respect for Neil before his Twitter"},{"body":"What about tweets? Those do anything?"},{"body":"Funny how everyone says 'thoughts and prayers' don't work and we need gun control when there's a school scooting, yet when there isn't terror attack if you say we need immigration control you get called a racist. Find it confusing tbh."},{"body":"The power of prayer doesn't save a loved one from dying, either. "},{"body":"It's stupid that people get offended at this sort of attitude. He's clearly trying to express his frustration through the most common scapegoat that people use. It's always the same \"pray for the lost ones\" people start to sound like robotic politicians.

Your make believe floating friend will never actually help you, ever"},{"body":"This latest disaster has been the first one since i’ve joined reddit, it’s been an interesting window into the American hang up on this issue. You’re all saying it mental health, can’t do anything about the guns. countries everywhere have people with mental health issues, but it’s only America that refuses to do anything about gun control, and only America that has a consistent problem with mass shootings. what’s the common factor here ..."},{"body":"It's called compassion.  Something the majority of Americans in later generations seems to have lost.\n\nRather than trying to fix something no law ever will (murder is illegal, yet people still murder regardless of method) how about we examine what changed in our society over the last 60+ years that gave rise to this type of violence. \n\nUp until the 80s there were gun clubs at schools.  Kids showed up with rifles on a rack in their vehicles.  \n\nFix your homes, be parents, stop the victim and entitlement mentality.   In short grow up and be accountable for you and yours.  Teach your children to be respectful of their life and they'll respect the life of others."},{"body":"But what about \"Thoughts\"? These pieces of shit always say \"THOUGHTS and prayers\".....😝"},{"body":"Honest question, would we rather have no thoughts/prayers and no action? Because I haven't seen anyone talking about how they don't pray but have taken action. Most of the comments are usually about how it's bad that there's thoughts and prayers without action. Where is the action from those comments? \n\nEither way what is so bad about thoughts and prayers anyway? Do we not wish people well when they are going to do something? Or wish them well when they are sick? So why can we not empathize and wish someone well when they are going through a tragedy. Some people aren't in a position to do any more than that anyway.

Prayers to the victim's families and the pleasant thought that they are with Jesus now really keeps this man awake at night.

Thought when powerful enough -- which it would be if the folks who claimed they were praying actually did the deed -- initiates action via will.  \n\nSomebody's not praying.

Gun laws and gun free zones keep criminals safe... Sad..."},{"body":"Wow....someone's so pissed at God he has to adopt that snarky tone to talk about prayers.

The population is mostly Christian, with 83% of black Americans identifying as Christian, including 45% who identify as baptist. Catholics account for 5% of the population. 1% identify as Muslim. About 12% of African American people do not have a religion and identify as atheist or agnostic, slightly lower than the figure for the whole of the USA.\n\nI thought only Chris Rock made black jokes.
